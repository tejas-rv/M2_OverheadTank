Water level indicators work by using sensor probes to indicate water levels in a storage tank. These probes send information back to the control panel to trigger an alarm or indicator. As mentioned above, the control panel can be programmed to automatically turn on your pump to refill the water again.

The two probes of the FC-28 allow the current to pass through the water, which gives the resistance value to measure the moisture value, which in turn used to measure the water level.
